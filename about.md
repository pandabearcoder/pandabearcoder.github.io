Hi I'm Von Louie! A Freelance Software Engineer based in Manila, PH. I use Python and Django as my bread
and butter.

I started using Python during my internship and fell in love with it so I decided to do
volunteer work for the [Python Philippines](https://python.ph/) community.

Most of the projects I've done are Web applications and I also do Mobile applications from
time to time. I contribute to open source projects that I used on my projects as a way of showing my
support.

<br/>
Here are some of the projects you could checkout on my Github account:

* [firechat-python](https://github.com/pandabearcoder/dotfiles) - A port of Google's firechatjs to
Python

* [virtual-dev-machine](https://github.com/pandabearcoder/virtual-dev-machine) - Python3 development environment using Virtualbox and Vagrant

* [trapiko](https://github.com/pandabearcoder/trapiko) - React Native based mobile app to show traffic
flow on the most common roads in Metro Manila

* [SchoolFinder](https://github.com/pandabearcoder/SchoolFinder) - Android mobile app to help students
to find a nearby school that caters K-12 education curriculum
