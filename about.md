Hi I'm Von Louie! A Freelance Software Engineer based in Manila, PH. I use Python and Django as my bread
and butter.

I started using Python during my internship and fell in love with it so I decided to do
volunteer work for the [Python Philippines](https://python.ph/) community.

Most of the projects I've done are Web applications and I also do Mobile applications from
time to time. I contribute to open source projects that I used on my projects as a way of showing my
support.

Here are some of the projects you could checkout on my Github account:

[dotfiles](https://github.com/pandabearcoder/dotfiles)

[firechat-python](https://github.com/pandabearcoder/dotfiles)

[virtual-dev-machine](https://github.com/pandabearcoder/virtual-dev-machine)
